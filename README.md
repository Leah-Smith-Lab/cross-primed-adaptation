   The folder is structured containing the required `input/` and `output/` subdirectories.

2. **Set your working directory** to the downloaded `Data_analysis` folder.  
   This ensures the analysis scripts can find inputs and save outputs in the right places.

3. Run your analysis scripts.  
   They will automatically:
   - Read input files from `input/`
   - Write results to `output/`
